[Link to the deployed version of the application](https://unit-conversion-app.netlify.app)

### Configuration instructions
This app is a simple static site that utilizes the DOM to display elements to the window object. This application should run in any up to date browser.

### Installation instructions
Since this application focuses mostly on unit conversion formulas rendered to the DOM there is nothing to install. 

### Operating instructions
cd into Unit-Conversion-App and double click the index.html file to run in browser, use an IDE code extension to open in browser, or visit the deployed link to the site listed above. 

### Deployment improvement tasks
1. Utilize an avaible API for the formulas and converstions. This would also be useful for GET, PUT, DELETE and POST requests. 

2. Refactor code to clean up the fuctionality of the application. 

3. Restyle the application to include more than basic styling. 

4. Write new onclick actions that show more visual representations of what is happening while using the application.

5. Add more detailed outputs and dropdowns. Group like fucntions together and redesign the application to only show: temperatures, volumes, or length measurements when selected. Since temperatures can not be converted to lengths, there is no need to show both options at once.

### Known bugs:
There is a known bug in this program. The invalid function was not working with the existing formulas and had to be removed as it rendered the existing code unsuable.

### Troubleshooting: 
If you are having trouble using the app make sure that you clear your cache and try again. Try reloading the app to reset the values if needed.
